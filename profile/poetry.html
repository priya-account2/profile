    <h2><center>LABOURERS DAY</h2>
    <pre><center>
    Labour is a crucial part of our life from birth to death,
    and today is a day to recognize that aspect of our existence
    Is it only those who go out to work or also every mother who diligently works from home,

    paying attention to the needs of the family?
    Are they just doing their duty, or do they, too, feel the weight of labor?
    Every student, too, acknowledges the toil by studying without direct financial gain.

    In the time of COVID, daily, without resting, to those who put their breath into work, Labourer's Day.
    On this Labourer's Day, let's extend our wishes not only to those who work for their families
    but also to those who toil for their nation and themselves.
    Happy Labourer's Day to all the hardworking individuals</p>
