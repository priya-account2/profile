  <h1>MY PROFILE</h1>
  <img src="profile.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="profile">
  <p>Hello everyone, I am Priyadharshini K, currently pursuing my third year in BSc Computer Science with cognitive systems at <a href="https://www.srcas.ac.in/" target="_blank">Sri Ramakrishna College of Arts and Science</a>. It's a pleasure to introduce myself and share a bit about my academic journey and aspirations.

My short-term goal is to successfully complete my degree in Computer Science. I am enthusiastic about diving deep into the world of computer science, gaining a comprehensive understanding of various concepts, and honing my skills to meet the challenges of the tech industry.

Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to become a proficient Full Stack Developer. I am passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly applications that can make a positive impact. 
I completed my secondary education at corporation girls higher secondary school, R.s.puram-west, Coimbatore, where I successfully completed both my 10th and 12th grades. In my 10th-grade board exams, <b>I scored 79%. Similarly, in my 12th-grade exams, I secured 79%. During my last semester I scored 83 %</b>. <b>I completed projects such as weather forecasting system and book borrowing systems</b>. During my leisure hours, I find joy in reading books, writing poetry, crafting poetry, and indulging in the hobby of collecting stamps. Here you can see some of my <a href="stamp.html" target="_blank">stamp collections</a> and <a href="poetry.html" target="_blank">poetries</a>. I believe in the power of teamwork and collaboration, as they are essential in creating innovative solutions.

As I embark on this journey towards Full Stack Development, I am excited about the learning opportunities, challenges, and growth that lie ahead. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals, mentors, and professionals who share a similar passion for technology and development.</p>
